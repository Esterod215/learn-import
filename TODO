todo:

-   handling other languages
-   handle all projects
-   sync process
-   fix images on all pages
-   vue logic - landing page icons
-   think through external reference code logic again - is hashing the page the right idea or just base64? - also in view of different product sections (commerce vs dxp)
-   handle zip files
-   discrepancy between articles found via api and those in system
-   better handling of images (not all of them are getting referenced)
-   go through all edge cases that rich identified
-   webdav also works to upload documents - and can overwrite them with new versions (do we want that?)
-   use parallel processing- -- cloud tasks?
-   hash content in custom field for syncing?
-   use freemarker for display
-   ja vs en images
-   deleting unneeded images / articles

downsides:

-   image names could shift
-   ties us to sphinx, at least at start
