todo:

-   error handling on api failure
-   image namespacing- commerce\_
-   handling other languages
-   handle all projects
-   sync process
-   fix images on all pages
-   vue logic - landing page icons
-   think through external reference code logic again - is hashing the page the right idea or just base64? - also in view of different product sections (commerce vs dxp)
-   handle zip files
-   better handling of images (not all of them are getting referenced)

downsides:

-   image names could shift
-   ties us to sphinx, at least at start
